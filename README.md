# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## User Story 

As chemistry students also taking a coding course, we want to have a meaningful impact within our school community by creating a software that utilizes computer science principles while also enabling students to succeed in their chemistry classes. Our software be an organized database of information of each element and will have a feature allowing students to search for specific information regarding specific elements.
