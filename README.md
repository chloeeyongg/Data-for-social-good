# Unit 3 - Data for Social Good Project 

## Introduction 

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need. 

## User Story 

As chemistry students also taking a coding course, we want to have a meaningful impact within our school community by creating a software that utilizes computer science principles while also enabling students to succeed in their chemistry classes. Our software be an organized database of information of each element and will have a feature allowing students to search for specific information regarding specific elements. 

## Dataset 

[Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type.

- **Name** (String) - name of the element
- **Symbol** (Sting) - symbol of the element
- **Atomic Number** (int) - the number of protons in the nucleus
- **Atomic Mass** (double) - the total mass of particles of matter in an atom

## Description 

This project is a chemistry database tool designed to help students easily search for and access key information about chemical elements. Using a dataset that includes details such as the element's name, symbol, atomic number, and atomic mass, the program allows users to input search terms via the Scanner class. Based on the user's input, it retrieves and displays the corresponding information, making it a useful resource for studying the periodic table. The project combines coding principles with chemistry concepts, providing a practical way for students to enhance their learning and better understand the properties of elements.
